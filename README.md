# Curriculum

This repo contains my up-to-date resume. It is designed in HTML & CSS with the goal in mind to be available as a [web page](ferdinandkeller.github.io/curriculum), meaning my resume is compatible with any screen size, including big desktop and small phone.

The website is also compatible with PDF exports. When a push is made to this repo, a [GitHub Action I createad](https://github.com/ferdinandkeller/html-to-pdf-action) automatically converts the HTML to a clean and modern PDF, which can then be downloaded from the `Releases` section. This automation relieves me not only of having to use Word or Illustrator to design something elegant, but also dispenses me of having to do twice the work (the first time for the website, and the second for the PDF).

If you are interested, don't hesitate to [get in contact with me](ferdinandkeller.github.io/curriculum).
